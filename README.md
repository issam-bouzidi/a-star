# A-star search algorithm
This is an A* pathfinder with Python
A-star search algorithm (also referred to as A*) is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs.  
It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution.
